Building city models
====================

DTCC Platform provides a number of tools for building city models from
raw data, both from the command-line and from Python.

Command-line interface
----------------------

The command-line tool ``dtcc-build`` builds a city model from a given data
directory and stores the generated city model as several mesh and data files in
the same directory. The following example illustrates how to build a city model
for the dataset ``helsingborg-residential-2022`` included as part of the demo
data::

    $ dtcc-build data/helsingborg-residential-2022

The single parameter to ``dtcc-build`` in this example is a directory of raw
data sources. If no argument is given, it is assumed that the data sources are
in the current working directory. The above example is thus equivalent to the
following::

    $ cd data/helsingborg-residential-2022
    $ dtcc-build

The data directory must contain the following input data:

* Point cloud data in `LAS/LAZ format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAS_file_format>`_ consisting of one or more files
  with suffix ``.las`` or ``.laz``.
* Building footprints in `shapefile format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile>`_  named ``footprints.[shp,shx,dbf,prj,cpg]``.
* Parameters used to control the city model generation stored
  as a JSON file named ``parameters.json`` (optional).

After the city model has been built, the generated data files can be found in the specified data directory. By default, the data will be saved in
`Protobuf format <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protocol_Buffers>`_. The following files will be generated:

* ``city.pb`` - city model in Protobuf format
* ``ground_mesh.pb`` - a (triangular) mesh of the ground (excluding buildings)
* ``building_mesh.pb`` - a (triangular) mesh of the buildings (excluding ground)
* ``volume_mesh.pb`` - a (tetrahedral) mesh of the city (the empty space between the ground, the buildings, and an enclosing bounding box)
* ``volume_mesh_boundary.pb`` - a (triangular) mesh of the boundary of the volume mesh (including both the ground and the buildings)

The ``dtcc-build`` command accepts a number of parameters that can be
used to control the generation of the city model, for example::

    $ dtcc-build --mesh_resolution 20.0 --domain_height 75.0 data/helsingborg-residential-2022

To print a list of available parameters, use the following command::

    $ dtcc-build --help

See the :ref:`Parameters` section below for more details.

Python interface
----------------

To build a city model from the Python interface, use the ``build`` function,
which is equivalent to running the ``dtcc-build`` command on the command-line:

.. code:: python

    # Set parameters
    p = parameters.default()
    p["data_directory"] = "data/helsingborg-residential-2022"
    p["mesh_resolution"] = 20.0
    p["domain_height"] = 75.0

    # Build city model
    build(p)

In this example, we first create a dictionary of default parameters by calling
``parameters.default()`` and then set the essential ``data_directory``
parameter. We also set the parameter ``mesh_resolution`` to 20.0 (meters),
telling the mesh generator to generate a mesh with a maximum cell size of 20.0
meters, and the ``domain_height`` parameter to 75.0 (meters), telling the mesh
generator to generate a mesh with a domain height of 75.0 meters. Finally, we
call the ``build`` function with the parameters to build the city model with the
given parameters.

For more fine-grained control of the city model generation, the functions
``build_city``, ``build_mesh``, and ``build_volume_mesh`` can be used. To use
these commands, we must first calculate the domain bounds and load the raw data:

.. code:: python

    origin, bounds = calculate_bounds(buildings_path, pointcloud_path, p)
    city = load_city(buildings_path, bounds=bounds)
    pointcloud = load_pointcloud(pointcloud_path, bounds=bounds)

where ``buildings_path`` is the path to the data file with building footprints 
(.shp) and ``pointcloud_path`` is the path to the folder where the 
pointcloud/pointclouds are stored.

We can then build the city model by calling the ``build_city`` function:

.. code:: python

    city = build_city(city, pointcloud, bounds, p)

Once the city model has been built, we may proceed to build (triangular) surface meshes and (tetrahedral) volume meshes for the city model:

.. code:: python

    ground_mesh, building_mesh = build_mesh(city, p)
    volume_mesh, volume_mesh_boundary = build_volume_mesh(city, p)

The data may then be save to file using the ``.save`` method and viewed using
the ``.view`` method, for example:

.. code:: python

    city.save("city.pb")
    city.view()

For a complete example, see the :ref:`build_city_and_meshes` demo.

.. note::

   Currently, only LoD1.2 city models are supported but work in
   progress is aiming to extend the capabilities to generate both
   LoD1.3 and LoD2.x models.

Parameters
----------

The city model and mesh generation may be controlled using a set of parameters.

When working from the command-line, the parameters may be specified either by passing them as command-line arguments or by storing them in a JSON file named ``parameters.json`` in the data directory. In a previous example, we saw the the following command-line call::

    dtcc-build --mesh_resolution 20.0 --domain_height 75.0 data/helsingborg-residential-2022

This is equivalent to the following JSON file present in the data directory::

    {
        "mesh_resolution": 20.0,
        "domain_height": 75.0
    }

When working from Python, the parameters are specified as a Python dictionary. The parameters in the above example may be specified by the following Python code::

    p = parameters.default()
    p["mesh_resolution"] = 20.0
    p["domain_height"] = 75.0

The list of available parameters can be viewed from the command-line by ``dtcc-build --help`` or from Python by ``print(parameters.default())``.
