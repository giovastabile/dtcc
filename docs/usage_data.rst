Downloading demo data
=====================

DTCC Platform provides a number of demo data sets that can be used for
demos and testing.

To download the demo data, run the following command::

    $ dtcc-download-demo-data

This will create a directory named ``data`` containing the
demo data sets.

.. note::

   For the following documentation, it is assumed that you have downloaded the
   demo data. It is also assumed that you have installed the ``dtcc`` Python
   module on your system by following the :ref:`Installation` instructions.
