# This demo illustrates how to build a city model from raw data,
# and viewing the resulting mesh model together with the pointcloud.

from pathlib import Path

# Build a mesh from raw data
data_directory = Path("../data/helsingborg-residential-2022")

city = dtcc.io.load_city(buildings_path, bounds=bounds)
pointcloud = dtcc.io.load_pointcloud(pointcloud_path, bounds=bounds)

# Build a city
city = dtcc.builder.build_city(city, pointcloud, bounds, p)

# From the city build meshes
ground_mesh, building_mesh = dtcc.builder.build_mesh(city, p)

# From the city build meshes
volume_mesh, boundary_mesh = dtcc.builder.build_volume_mesh(city)

# Remove unwanted outliers from the point cloud
pc = pointcloud.remove_global_outliers(3)

# View the gorund mesh togheter with the pointcloud
ground_mesh.view(pc=pc)

# Alternatively the pointcloud can be viewed with the mesh as agument
# pointcloud.view(mesh=ground_mesh)
